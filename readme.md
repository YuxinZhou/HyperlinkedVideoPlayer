Hyper-video is a displayed video stream that contains embedded, user-clickable anchors allowing navigation between video and other hypermedia elements. 
Hyper-video is thus analogous to hypertext, where reader clicks on a word in one document to retrieve information from another document, or from another place in the same document. 
Hyper-video combines video with a non-linear information structure, allowing a user to make choices based on the content of the video and the user's interests.
